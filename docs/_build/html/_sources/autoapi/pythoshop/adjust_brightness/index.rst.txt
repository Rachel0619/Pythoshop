.. py:function:: adjust_brightness(image_path, brightness_factor)

   Adjust the brightness of an image and save the result.

   This function changes the brightness of an input image by a specified factor. The factor can be
   positive to increase brightness or negative to decrease it. The brightness change is applied
   uniformly to all pixels of the image.

   :param image_path: The file path to the image that needs brightness adjustment. The image can be in .jpg or .png format.
   :type image_path: str
   :param brightness_factor: A value that determines the amount by which to adjust the brightness. Positive values increase
                             brightness, while negative values decrease it.
   :type brightness_factor: int or float

   :returns: The adjusted image is saved as a .png file at the same location as the input with "_brightened" appended
             to the original filename.
   :rtype: None

   :raises IOError: If the image file cannot be opened or saved.
